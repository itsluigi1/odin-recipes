        <h2>The Pabellon</h2>
        <p>It's a traditional Venezuelan dish that is considered the national dish. 
            It mixes elements from the three different cultures that intermixed during Spanish colonial times: Native Americans, 
            Spanish and Africans</p>
        <p>The name pabell√≥n means flag, and the dish is arranged on the plate so that the red tomatoes and steak, black beans, 
            and the white rice resemble the three stripes of a tri-color flag.</p>

        <h4>How To Make Pabellon</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place the flank steak in a pot with the bouillon, and cover with water.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and simmer on low for 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Saute half of the minced garlic in a medium pot with 4 tablespoons of the vegetable oil for 1 to 2 minutes over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the rice to the boiling water, lower the heat, and simmer the rice, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the rice covered for 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil to a skillet, and saute half the chopped onions with the rest of the minced garlic until soft.</li>
            <li>Add the can of black beans (undrained), 1/2 cup water, chicken bouillon, cumin, garlic powder, vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes, until the liquid is reduced.</li>
            <li>Slice the cooled steak against the grain into thin slices. The meat should be very tender and falling apart. Shred the larger pieces into bite-size pieces with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons butter to a skillet and cook the rest of the chopped onions until soft. Add the tomatoes, 1 cup of the steak pan juices, and the sliced steak and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
            <li>Arrange the meat and tomatoes on 1/3 of a serving platter. Place the rice next to the meat, and then place the beans on the other side of the rice, to resemble the stripes of a tri-color flag.</li>
            <li>Serve with fried plantains on the side and enjoy!</li>
