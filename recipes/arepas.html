        <h2>The Original Arepa</h2>
        <p>The Arepa is a traditional venezuelan dish made with corn flour and water,
            usually made for breakfast but it can be eaten at anytime of day and for any meal.
        </p>
        <p>It's a very simple recipe, you only need 3 ingredients, 30mins of your time and one pan</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Corn Flour</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Oil (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How To Make An Arepa</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve salt into the water and slowly add the masarepa until a loose dough forms, 
                stirring with a spoon or your hands.</li>
            <li>Once you get your dough where it should be, 
                let it rest for 5 minutes. Then scoop out fist-size portions and form into a ball.</li>
            <li>Once your arepas are formed, simply pan-fry in a little oil to form a crust (a little deep blackening is OK!), 
                and then finish in the oven to ensure the centers are cooked through (optional but recommended). Then enjoy!</li>        
        </ol>
